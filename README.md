# Edge Detection Combined with Smoothing and Thresholding
## Overview 
 This project is about edge detection using Sobel Operator Combined with Smoothing such as Avverging and Gaussian filters and Thresholding. The project has four main goals which are:
 - Implementation of different types of smoothing filters such as Averaging and Gaussian filters.
 - Implementation of edge detection using the Sobel operator.
 - Implementation of different type of thresholding.
 - Finally, detecting a specific required target in the image and isolate it (The Large Blood Vessel in the centre o the image).
