# Edge Detection Combined with Smoothing and Thresholding Proj10-01
## Overview 
This project is about edge detection using Sobel operator combined with smoothing such as Avverging and Gaussian filters and thresholding. The project has four main goals which are:
 - Implementation of different types of smoothing filters such as Averaging and Gaussian filters.
 - Implementation of edge detection using the Sobel operator method.
 - Implementation of different types of thresholdings.
 - Finally, detecting a specific required target in the image and isolate it. In this case, the Large blood vessel in the centre o the image is the target that needs to be isolated.
